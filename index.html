			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>
			I'm born and raised in Northridge, California. I studied Enivironmental Economics and Finance at UC Berkeley and I worked in various finance and audit roles for more than 5 years in the San Francisco Bay Area. I've recently relocated to San Diego primarily to be closer to family, pursue the web development program at UCSD, and explore all the fun that comes with being in a new city. 
			</p>
			<p>
			For me this is a complete career transition and an opportunity to tap into my creative mind and study and contribute to a rapidly evolving and challenging field. I've always enjoyed building things such as meccano, solving puzzles, playing chess, and using my creative and strategic mind to test the limits of all I can do. I'm hoping that after this web development program I will have attained the core skills necessary to design dynamic websites and build robust web applications.
